			<p>Greta is a former Latin teacher from North Carolina who spent over a decade dragging bratty middle school students to all the Roman ruins in Western Europe.  Then she discovered Temporal Tours!  Let her lead you into the dark days of the death of the Republic--just try not to get knifed in the back on our <b>Assassination of Caesar Tour</b>! </p>
			<p>
			The granddaughter of a naval aviator, Greta spent summers at the Naval Air Museum at Naval Air Station Pensacola, making burnt sacrifices to the replica of the Wright Brothers' original plane.  Follow her to the birthplace of flight on our <b>First in Flight Tour</b> and take your turn at the controls!</p>
