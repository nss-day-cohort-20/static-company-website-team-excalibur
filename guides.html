			<h2>Greta Moseley</h2>
	

			<p>Greta is a former Latin teacher from North Carolina who spent over a decade dragging bratty middle school students to all the Roman ruins in Western Europe.  Then she discovered Temporal Tours!  Let her lead you into the dark days of the death of the Republic--just try not to get knifed in the back on our <b>Assassination of Caesar Tour</b>!&lowast; </p>
			<p>
			The granddaughter of a naval aviator, Greta spent summers at the Naval Air Museum at Naval Air Station Pensacola, making burnt sacrifices to the replica of the Wright Brothers' original plane.  Follow her to the birthplace of flight on our <b>First in Flight Tour</b> and take your turn at the controls!&lowast;</p>

			<!-- Pompeii, Oregon Trail -->

			<p>Emily is a former Latin teacher who is thrilled to have launched a new career with Temporal Tours.&lowast;  Join her in exploring the city of Pompeii just before its historic preservation and devastation under the eruption of Vesuvius in 79CE. She loves that she gets to visit the living city now with Temporal Tours after having taken several field trips to the present-day excavation. Join her on the <b>Destruction of Pompeii Tour</b> and experience it for yourself. Sign up for our mailing list for updates about future expansions into Herculaneum!</p> 
			<p>As a child, Emily loved playing the computer game based on the American journey west on the Oregon Trail. After doing lots of research and playing through the game hundreds of times, she can assure you there is no substitute for the real thing.&lowast; Outfit your wagon and follow her westward on our <b>Oregon Trail Tour</b>!</p><!--placeholder text-->

			<p>Formally working with a musician to make songs and children's books this guide will give you through dicotamy of your trip as you are enjoying the lovely view of Earth from the <b>Moon Landing trip</b> or it's <b>Triassic past!</b>&lowast;</p>

			<p>Earth never looked better than when you combine both trips! Take that Neil, we were on the moon before it was cool! Please refrain from taking dinosaurs with you from the past, especially the raptors!&lowast; This tends to complicate things for the triassic tour guides.</p> <!--placehoulder text-->

	&lowast; No longer for kids because our legal team wised up!
	&lowast; Likely to be arrested on landing. The 1903 prision tour is a free side-tour that some people stay to enjoy!
	&lowast; This is our 4th Emily! We just can't stop recruiting her!
	&lowast; It helps to have a robust immune system.
	&lowast; Trip durations vary depending on survival rate, remember oxygen and dino spray not included. Prehistoric Earth has plenty of spare oxygen for the moon trip if you want to go on our tours again!
	&lowast; Clever girl.
	&lowast; He is now an expert at growing prehistoric planets but seems unresponsive and decomposed.
